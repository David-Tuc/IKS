# PASOCS  
##### (Parallel Approximate SOlver for the Credal Semantics)

This repository contains the compiled executable for PASOCS for different platforms. PASOCS is a solver for probabilistic logic programs (PLP) interpreted under the Credal semantics. Under this semantics, the logic program need not be stratified: they can accept multiple worlds (called answer sets). 

It allows to model complex relational model using first-order logic rules and represent non additive probabilities. We provide a few examples of how this semantics (and PASOCS) might be use, including computing Belief and Plausibility functions in the Dempster-Schaffer theory. It allows for modeling probabilistic events in the case of lack of knowledge, without having to make an assumption on the distribution of unknown events.  

This solver main goal is to allow for exact inference by enumerating all the possible worlds and approximate inference through sampling. It makes use of parallelization to help speed-up computation. At the moment, the solver only allows for shared memory parallelization but will allow in the future using multiple nodes. 

## What is the Credal Semantics ?

The Credal semantics is a probabilistic semantics for logic programs based on the Answer set Semantics for ASP. It allows a total choice (of the probabilistic variables) to yield multiple worlds/models (answer sets) and does not make any assumption as to how to redistribute the probability to each world/model (answer set). 

The Credal semantics of a PLP is thus not a single probability distribution but a set of probability distributions, that is characterized by its lower and upper bound. PASOCS returns these lower and upper bounds for each query. 

For more details about the credal semantics, we invite you to check out these papers:

PASOCS makes uses at the moment of the following third party tools:

- [Clingo](https://github.com/potassco/clingo) ([License](https://github.com/potassco/clingo/blob/master/LICENSE.md))


## Sampling algorithms

PASOCS provide an exact inference algorithm together with three sampling algorithms: naive, Metropolisâ€“Hastings MCMC and (block) Gibbs MCMC. These sampling algorithms sample the total choices.

While exact inference doesn't require hyper-parameters, the sampling algorithm need stopping criteria, and extra for the MCMC methods. **More details about the parameters are given in the command line options bellow.**

### Stopping criteria

PASOCS accepts multiple queries in parallel, each possibly having different evidence. As so, we do not define only one maximum number of samples to take. Indeed, PASOCS keeps counts for each queries of how many samples made the evidence true, meaning that a query with an evidence that has very low probability might have rejected most of the samples taken. To take this into account, we have a hyper-parameter called `min_samples` which states that each query should at least have counted `min_samples` non-rejected samples. To avoid the system continuing ad aeternam is a query has a evidence with extremely low probability, the user can define a parameter `max_samples` which is the hard limit on how many samples the system can take in total.

We also provide another stopping criteria in the form of an error bound heuristic using the TCL. The system computes the error bounds on the prediction (as we are estimating bernoulli variables) given a user define [`percentile`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile), and the `threshold` that we would like this uncertainty to be under. This is in no case a hard constraints, it is a statistical estimate and does not guaranty that the true probability lies in the uncertainty segment outputed. 

To deactivate any of the stopping criteria (`min_samples`, `max_samples` and `threshold`) the user can simply set it to -1.

### Sampling parameters for MCMC

For the MCMC methods, we also need to define how many `burn` steps to execute before using the Markoc Chain. For the MH MCMC sampling, our hidden markov chain considers the current total choice, and switches the value each probabilistic fact with a preset probability `mh_prob`. For the Gibbs MCMC sampling, the user can define the size of the block by setting the `gibbs_block` parameter.

## Installation

We distribute the compiled version of the software, so to run it on your computer select the appropriate folder depending on your OS and run the command line `pasocs` in the folder which contains the executable with the libraries.
It is important to keep the dynamic libraries (.dll or .so) in the folder with the PASOCS executable.

## How do I use it ?

### Running PASOCS

To use PASOCS, run the command line: 

```
pasocs <pasocs_program_path> [--options...]
```
for linux

```
pasocs.exe <pasocs_program_path> [--options...]
``` 
for windows

`<pasp_program_path>` is the path to the PASOCS program, which can be followed by a list of options [--options...] that are described bellow. 

If you have cloned this repository, from the beginning the following command should work (placing you shell in the appropriate folder)

```
pasocs ../examples/simple.pasocs
```
for linux

```
pasocs.exe ../examples/simple.pasocs
``` 
for windows

(The pasocs programs can have any extensions, they are in essence text files.)

Here is an example of command line with options (detailed below)
```
pasocs test_lp_files/test.pasocs --n_cpus 4 -q wind(d1) -m 2 -n_min 10000 -ut 0.1 -hm 0.3
```

### How do I write a PASOCS program

A PASOCS program is a set of probabilistic facts, a logic program and a set of queries. All together they form all the information the PASOCS needs. Here is an example of simple PASOCS program:
```
0.4::sunshine(X) :- var1(X).
0.8::warm(X) :- var1(X).
0.3::tired(X) :- var1(X).
0.6::wind(X) :- var1(X).
0.4::wake_up.


% This is a comment
var1(d1).
var1(d2).
run(X) :- var1(X), wake_up, not walk(X), sunshine(X), not wind(X).
walk(X) :- var1(X), wake_up, not run(X).
sick(X) :- var1(X), run(X), tired(X).
sick(X) :- var1(X), walk(X), not warm(X).

#query(sick(d1)). 
#query(sick(d2)). 
```

It has one ground probabilistic fact `0.4::wake_up` and a 4 non-ground probabilistic facts (line 1-4). Then the logic program is defined and finally the queries. 
A commented line starts with a `%`, **Do not put comments on the same line as probabilistic facts or queries !**

#### Probabilistic facts

Probabilistic facts (PFs) can either be ground or non-ground. With non-ground PFs you are obliged to provide a body which gives to PASOCS instructions on how to ground it. Here are examples of declaration of probabilistic facts:

```
0.4::p.
0.4::p :- b1, not b2, b3.
0.4::p;0.6::q.
0.4::p;0.5::q.
0.4::p;0.6::q :- b1, not b2, b3.
0.4::p;0.5::q :- b1, not b2, b3, b4.
0.4::p;0.3::q;0.1::r.
0.4::p(X) :- r(X), q.
0.4::p(X);0.6::q(X) :- r(X).
0.4::p(X);0.6::q(Y) :- r(X), s(Y).
```

I have included here multiple examples to highlight different behaviors:
    
   - `0.4::p.` is the simplest way to declare a probabilistic fact, this means that `p` is true with probability 0.4 and false with probability 0.6.
   - `0.4::p :- b1, not b2, b3` is a simple probabilistic fact with a body. This means that when the condition `b1, not b2, b3` is met, `p` is true with probability 0.4. In practice, this is replaced by a clause `p :- b1, not b2, b3, pfi` and the PF `0.4::pfi` is added to the program.
   - `0.4::p;0.6::q` is an annotated disjunction. This means that this PF can take two values `p` or `q`, and takes value `p` with probability 0.4 and value `q` with probability 0.6. It is different than from writing `0.4::p. 0.6::q` as this would mean that `p` is true with probability 0.4 and `q` is true with probability 0.6 and it is possible for `p` and `q` to both be true at the same time. Whereas with an annotated disjunction it is either one or the other. In practice this is a syntactic sugar and is transformed into a set of probabilistic facts by PASOCS. 
   - `0.4::p;0.5::q.` is the same as above, but shows that in an annotated disjunction the probabilities need not sum to 1 (though they need to sum to a value lower than 1). Here with probability 0.1 neither `p` and `q` are true. 
   - `0.4::p;0.6::q :- b1, not b2, b3.` and `0.4::p;0.5::q :- b1, not b2, b3, b4.` are ground annotated disjunction with bodies
   - `0.4::p;0.3::q;0.1::r.` is an annotated disjunction with three elements in the disjunction.
   - `0.4::p(X) :- r(X), q.` is a non-ground probabilistic fact. This will be replaced by all possible groundings of p(X) and a independent probabilistic fact will be created for each grounding. Note that the ground body is kept when the grounding is done, so `q` will appear in each ground clause. 
   - `0.4::p(X);0.6::q(X) :- r(X).` is a non-ground annotated disjunction, where both `p` and `q` have the same variable.
   - `0.4::p(X);0.6::q(Y) :- r(X), s(Y).` is a non-ground annotated disjunction which shows that we can have multiple variables in the disjunction.

**Note that in these examples I have only used predicates of arity 1 or 0 but any predicate can be used.**

#### Logic Program

The logic program of the pasocs program is written in ASP and accepts all of Clingo's syntax. We can for example use choice rules `1{p(1), p(2)}2.` or aggregation. 

For a full documentation of Clingo's syntax please see [https://github.com/potassco/guide/releases](https://github.com/potassco/guide/releases).

#### Queries

Queries are what instructs PASOCS to count the probabilities. They are written as part of the program and multiple ones can be run at the same time. They accept evidence and disjunction queries. To declare a query, use write it as follows:

```
#query(my_query_here).
```

(Do not forget the `.` at the end).
Here are some examples of queries

```
#query(a, not b, c).
#query(not c).
#query(a|b:true).
#query(a|b:true, c:false).
#query(a, not b, not c|d:true).
#query(a;b).
#query(a;b|d:true).
#query(a;b, not c|d:true).
```

As shown, queries are form of the queries atoms and of evidence. Moreover, we can have disjunctive queries:

- `#query(a, not b, c).` asks what is the probability for `a` to be true, `b` to be false and `c` to the true at the same time.
- `#query(not c).` asks what is the probability for `c` to be false.
- `#query(a|b:true).` is a conditional query: what is the probability of `a` to be true given that `b` is true. 
- `#query(a|b:true, c:false).` asks what is the probability of `a` is to be true given that `b` is true and `c` is false.
- `#query(a, not b, not c|d:true).` asks what is the probability of `a` to be true, `b` to be false and `c` false (all three at the same time) given that `d` is true.
- `#query(a;b).` is a disjunctive query. It asks what is the probability that either `a` or `b` are true.
- `#query(a;b|d:true).` asks what is the probability of either `a` or `b` to be true given that `d` is true.
- `#query(a;b, not c|d:true).` asks what is the probability that either `a` is true or `b` is true and `c` is false given that `d` is true.

### Command like options

When calling PASOCS, we would more often than not define a series of options. Here is an example:
```
pasocs test_lp_files/test.pasocs --n_cpus 4 -q wind(d1) -m 2 -n_min 10000 -ut 0.1 -hm 0.3
```
Most option require a user set value, which is given after the option name with a space separating it. Each option usually has a long name `--long_name` and a short one `-short`, both can be used interchangeably.

##### Algorithm Choice
- `--solving_mode`, `-sm` followed by a number `(0|1|2|3)`. It selects the solving algorithm to use: 0:Exact Inference, 1:Naive Sampling, 2:MH Sampling, 3: Gibbs Sampling. Default is 0.

##### Sampling stopping criterium
- - `--n_min_samples`, `-n_min` followed by a `int`, is the way to set the `min_samples` sampling stopping criteria. If the threshold of uncertainty is not reached, we sample at least `min_samples` for each query (queries may have different count due to evidence rejection). Set to -1 to deactivate this stopping criteria. Default is -1.
- `--n_max_samples`, `-n_max` followed by a `int`, is the way to set the `max_samples` sampling stopping criteria. Hard stop on the total number of samples taken. In case the evidence has a low probability, to avoid sampling forever. Can be set to -1 to deactivate it. Default is 50000.
- `--uncertainty_threshold`, `-ut` followed by a `double` \<1, is the way to set the `threshold` stopping criteria. Set to -1 to deactivate this stopping criteria. Default is 0.05. PASOCS will sample until each query has an uncertainty under this threshold (or some other stopping criteria is met).
- `--percentile`, `-p` followed by a `double` is the way to set the `percentile` parameter. As we estimate the uncertainty using a gaussian, we have to give the percentile we would like to use. For example, using the 97.5th percentile, we mean '95% of the possible values for the probability need to be under the uncertainty threshold'. Usual values are :  1. =>68%, 2=>95%, 3=>99.7%. Default is 1.96.

##### MCMC specific parameters
- `--burn`, `-b` followed by a `int` is the way to set the `burn` parameter. Number of samples to use at the burning step (for MCMC samplings). Default is 100.
- `--mh_prob`, `-mh` followed by a `double` is the way to set the `mh_prob` parameter. For MH MCMC sampling. It is the probability for each of the random variable to switch value at each sample. Prefer a lower value for stability. Default is 0.3.
- `--gibbs_block`, `-gb` followed by an `int` is the way to set the `gibbs_block` parameter. Block size for gibbs sampling. Default is 1.

##### Parallelization parameters
- `--n_cpus` followed by an `int`, number of threads/CPUs we would like the solver to use. Default is 1.
- `--sample_batch`, `-sb` followed by an `int`, Number of samples to run at once when doing sampling before computing the uncertainty and verifying the stopping criteria. Default is 100.

##### Hand Feeding
- `--query`, `-q` followed by a query string without `#query().` (for example just `not a, b|c:true`). It is in theory possible to do this but is not recommended and hasn't been tested much.

##### Others
- `--verbose`, `-v` followed by a `int`. Prints details of the computation. (1: Parsed program, ground pfs; 2: Detail of answer sets for each total choice when doing exact inference(to use with --n_cpus=1)
- `--help`, `-h`: displays the help page.

##### Output
- `output_path`, `-op` followed by a `path`. If specified, fill an output file with the results in CSV format. It will create the file if it doesn't exist.
